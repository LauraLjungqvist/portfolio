        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <hr>
        I am a developer with digital marketing, sales, content development, and community management skills.
        I've studied photography, design and autonomous arts at the Minerva school for Fine Arts and Design in Groningen (Netherlands). Technology, social media and coding have been a life long passion of mine.
        Additional to several years experience as a freelancer, I have 4 years professional working experience. And am also a hobbyist blogger, photographer and gamer, with a curiosity for illustrations and videography.
        People have described me as creative, self reliant and can take initiative. I have managed teams of 10-25 people, but can also spend hours working by myself. Currently my learning focus is on Angular and ethical design.
